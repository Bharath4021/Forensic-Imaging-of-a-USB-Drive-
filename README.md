# Forensic-Imaging-of-a-USB-Drive-
I used a practical forensic imaging exercise on FTK Imager, a digital-forensics tool used to generate the exact copy of drives and did not modify the original evidence. I prepared my USB flash drive to duplicate an actual investigative scenario. I added pictures and text documents to the drive before removing them to demonstrate user who had tried to delete sensitive information. The Windows Diskpart utility enabled me to set the USB drive to read-only status for evidence acquisition purposes. The media read-only function maintains the original data content while blocking any forensic data corruption that might occur during imaging operations.

I used FTK Imager to create a forensic image of the USB drive before returning the image file to the program for analysis. The evidence image in FTK imager displayed the complete structure of the USB device which allowed me to restore all files and folders to their original state. The imaging process retained all active files together with hidden files and deleted files which remained stored in the unallocated space section. The file signature functionality in FTK Imager allowed me to view file contents and recover deleted files through its navigation and preview window features . The FTK Imager tool revealed traces of deleted information which remained on the device even though regular system access could not detect these files . The imaging process successfully captured all drive data which standard copying methods would have failed to detect. The forensic image analysis instead of original USB drive usage protected evidence integrity throughout the entire investigation. The forensic imaging process demonstrated its ability to perform complete non-destructive digital storage device analysis for forensic investigations.

A forensic image represents an exact duplicate of all digital storage device data including USB drives and hard disks and memory cards. A forensic image contains complete device data whereas a standard image or file copy only duplicates files which the operating system can access. The imaging process includes all files that users have deleted and all hidden files and all areas between files which contain remnants of deleted data known as slack space. The image contains all unallocated free spaces which store remnants of data that users deleted before acquisition.

The creation of a forensic image protects all important evidence from destruction while creating an exact duplication of the original device at the time of acquisition. The forensic imaging process occurs through controlled procedures using FTK imager as one of the tools. The software produces an authentic duplicate through hash value generation and verification which confirms both the image integrity and authenticity. Forensic images allow investigators to perform safe analysis without damaging the original evidence. The method maintains evidence integrity through chain of custody preservation which enables digital evidence recovery and analysis for legal presentation during investigations.
